# Overview
We conducted a large-scale transcriptome study with 6,386 RNA sequencing data covering 27 immune cell types from 159 SLE and 89 healthy donors.

## Main findings
1. We first profiled two distinct cell-type-specific transcriptomic signatures: disease-state and disease-activity signatures, reflecting disease establishment and exacerbation, respectively.

2. We next identified candidate biological processes unique to each signature.

3. This study suggested the clinical value of disease-activity signatures, which were associated with organ involvement and responses to therapeutic agents such as belimumab.

4. However, disease-activity signatures were less enriched around SLE risk variants than disease-state signatures, suggesting that the genetic studies to date may not well capture clinically vital biology in SLE.
