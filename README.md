# Overview
We conducted a large-scale transcriptome study with 6,386 RNA sequencing data covering 27 immune cell types from 159 SLE and 89 healthy donors.

## Main findings
- We first profiled two distinct cell-type-specific transcriptomic signatures: disease-state and disease-activity signatures, reflecting disease establishment and exacerbation, respectively.

- We next identified candidate biological processes unique to each signature using multiple dataset (cytokine, transcription factor activity, pathway).

- This study suggested the clinical value of cell-type-specific disease-activity signatures, which were associated with organ involvement (e.g., mucocutaneous, musculoskeletal and renal) and responses to therapeutic agents such as belimumab.

- However, disease-activity signatures were less enriched around SLE risk variants than disease-state signatures, suggesting that the genetic studies to date may not well capture clinically vital biology in SLE.

We profiled 6,386 RNA sequencing data of 27 immune cell types from peripheral blood in HC and SLE patients (left). We identified two distinct categories of disease-relevant signatures in a cell-type-specific manner (middle), and then performed extensive downstream analyses (i-v). LDA, low diseae activity; MDA, moderate disease activity; HDA, high disease activity; BLM, belimumab; TF, transcription factor; EAS, East Asian; EUR, European.
